# Blockchain Based Disaster Management System
Project's main goal and motivation are to provide a new blockchain based solution to disaster management. Disaster management consists of a series of disaster-related information processes in which the information is processed, stored, and disseminated to make effective decisions and construct a plan. Most of the current disaster management systems are infrastructure-dependent and work in a centralized manner, which can pose a threat in certain devastating outcomes. The involvement of both the government and the public is important in gathering and disseminating information, and their effectiveness would be severely diminished if these centralized and infrastructure dependent systems were to fail during the moments of disaster.
